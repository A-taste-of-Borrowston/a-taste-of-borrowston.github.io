We have started in 10 Borrowston, Carloway, Isle of Lewis in april 2022. We want to make it our home and produce tasty and healthy food for ourselves. At the moment there is no dwelling on the croft and we are living nearby in Garenin. We are interested in farming while trying to be in balance with our soil and environment or even improve it when possible. In the process we sometimes have too much food available and will sell it. We might provide updates of the evolution of the croft as we work the land.
