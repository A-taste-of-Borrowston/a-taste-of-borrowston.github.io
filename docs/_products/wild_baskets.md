Julien has been weaving for years as a hobby but also to get baskets, ropes and tools needed for the house and the croft. He practice a number of classic and original techniques and knows how to weave a large number of plants. 

All our baskets can be fixed for free if they are reparable in a reasonable time and do not show signs of abuse. Wear and tear is normal in a basket and it may need fixing every couple of years. Handles can break, the wood may work. These are all things that can be generally dealt with. 

## Price

* small egg basket £27
* Basket/rope on order __£10/h__ of weaving
