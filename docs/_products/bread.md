Our homemade sourdough bread is using organic wheat premium flour.

This is bread in its simplest form made with our own starter, organic flour and patience.

We bake for ourselves at least twice a week and could add another loaf if needed. Just order a bit in advance and see if there is room in the oven.

## Price

* __Â£3.5__ the loaf of 500g

Please [get in touch](mailto:dsl6a04ab@mozmail.com) if you want to buy our products.
