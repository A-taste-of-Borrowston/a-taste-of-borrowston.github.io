Our eggs are produced by open-pasture ducks that can roam freely on a large part of the croft and forage a lot. They taste delicious!

We have 3 ducks on the croft that have the task of clearing the place of slugs, opening the drains and cheering us up. They were our first animals and they really do an amazing work. They also produce excellent eggs. This is all subject to availability as they are not many.
