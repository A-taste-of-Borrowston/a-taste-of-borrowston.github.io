After having used all kind of website technologies in the past 25 years, I got back to simplicity. 
It turns out the Internet is using a lot of energy to serve our websites and that we should reduce their usage as much as possible. 

So here we are on a homemade static website, hosted on github, no server database, no php, no wordpress, wix and whatnot. For me, this is a nearly a full loop since 98 although so much simpler to make and deploy.

We were looking for a croft for quite a few years and got this unique chance to make Borrowston our home. At the moment, the croft is mostly grass and rotten posts. However, it is evolving and we hope in an interesting way. We feel extremely lucky and we are learning so much. We hope we can share some of the wonders we observe but also some of the product we make.

There is quite a back log but we will do a few restrospectives on the evolution and check as spring develop, what is happening.
