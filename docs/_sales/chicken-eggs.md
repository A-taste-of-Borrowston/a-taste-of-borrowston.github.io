Our eggs are produced by open-pasture hen that can roam freely on a large part of the croft and forage a lot. They taste delicious!

We have 11 hen of different breeds happily roaming the croft and enjoying their time. The weather is rough but they have good shelters and plenty of space to hide and forage. 
The term open-pasture is used because free-range today corresponds to a chicken having 4 m² outside to live off. We haven't exactly calculated but each hen may have a 100 m² or more. They seem happy and healthy which is the way it should be.
