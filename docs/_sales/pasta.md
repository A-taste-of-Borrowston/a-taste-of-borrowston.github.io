Our home-made pasta are using organic wheat premium flour and our open-pasture eggs.They are delicious, try it!

We make a lot of things ourselves at home. Making pasta has been a staple food in my house for decades and we are happy to share these with our neighbours. There is nothing like it in the shops, believe me. They are ideal for a healthy meal and will cook in a very short time so you can focus on making a nice sauce or just add a some garlic and olive oil. 

We will also make speciality pasta including laver, different plants and grains as they become of season.
We can make lasagne, fettuccine and tagliolini

## price

* Â£1 per portion (2x 75g). A portion is for one person as a full meal, two if it is a secondary side dish.

## remark
We generally do not provide packaging, we do exchange them with our customers. We also can deliver if you are in Carloway or Shawbost.
Please order them in advance as they are best fresh.

## How to cook
Fresh pasta are much fresher than shop ones. Once you have your water to a hard boil, add a few drops of olive oil and salt. If you have a little home-made stock somewhere that adds a lot too. Then add the pasta, try to not clump them. They will float when cooked. For best results you can fish them as they come up so that they are all cooked similarly. The cooking may only take 30s if there is a lot of water boiling hard.
