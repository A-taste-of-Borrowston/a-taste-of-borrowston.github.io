All what we make from the croft that we may have available. All our products are trying to be organic or free-range and following permaculture principles for a healthy and sustainable food supply. We do not provide packaging so if we give you some to help, we would like it back or the best is to come with yours and we will fill it up.
Each product is subject to availability and is an excess of what we try to get for ourselves. We are not a market grower, we try to get gentle prices for healthy food and share it as much as possible.
