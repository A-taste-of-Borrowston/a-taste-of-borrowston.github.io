# Ingredients

 * fresh pasta (150g/person). I like some speciality pasta with it (_e.g._ nettle or ground elder)
 * 1 to 2 leek per person thinly diced
 * 1 thinly diced carrot
 * 50 cl or more of kefir
 * salt & pepper
 * optional spice, I like some cardamom seeds
 * 1 thinly diced clove of garlic
 * chilli


# Instructions

1. Put the leek into a wok pan without oil and add some salt and a tiny amount of water. Keep on stiring until the leek has sweat water and starts to grill. At the same time, boil water with a pinch of salt and a spoon of olive oil.
2. Add oil in the wok with the diced carrot and the spices if you wish.
3. Once the carrots are slightly grilled, cover the vegetables with water and wait until the water is fully absorbed.
4. Put the fresh pasta in the boiling water to cook. At the same time, add the kefir on the vegetables. Add the garlic in the wok and the chilli.
5. Once the pasta float in the boiling water transfer them into the wok. Put the equivalent of a glass of the cooking water of the pasta in the wok.
6. Cook until you have reduced the sauce to your taste and serve immediately.
