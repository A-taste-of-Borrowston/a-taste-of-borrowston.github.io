This is Julien's breakfast since a very long time. It is simple, nutritious and healthy.

# Ingredients
![toasts]({{ '/images/recipes/eggs/toasts.jpg' | absolute_url}}){: .align-right}
 * 2 eggs
 * 2 slices of sourdough bread
 * a spoonfull of diced onions
 * some spice. Here on the baneer, the startled eggs spice is wild carrot, a favourite. I like paprika and peper-dulse too.
 * butter
 * a pinch of salt (if the butter is not salted)
 * lettuce or another fresh salad-type vegetable (spinach or ground elder are nice too!)
 * _optional_ sliced mushroom
 
# Instructions
1. Preheat the pan at medium temperature. I use a cast iron pan since a while as it is much better to cook and doesn't leach any chemical.  
2. Butter your bread, add the salad on top
3. Put optional thinly sliced mushrooms before oiling the pan. Press the mushrooms to remove the water from it.
4. add a little oil and throw the onions. Wait until they start to be clear and a bit yellow.
5. Add the eggs and add your spices + pepper. When they are cooked to your taste, add them on top of your bread.
6. Enjoy!
